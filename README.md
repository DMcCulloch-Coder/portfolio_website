Creating a Website to House My Portfolio!

---------------------------------------------
# Motivation
I wanted to create a website to display my web dev ability and to showcase at least two projects (coming soon...)
My secondary motivation is to refamiliarize myself with my Javascript Tech Stack

---------------------------------------------
# Tech
The website will be written in plain javascript using SCSS for style.
It will also contain an incredibly simple node.js backend to send emails to me from my contact form.
I also plan to deploy this to my website: dmcculloch-coder.com
I'll figure out hosting once I get further along.

---------------------------------------------
# Project Plans!
I plan on adding two projects:
1) React website with interesting interactions connected to a meaty, free API with a node.js backend.
2) Either I find a buisness to make an actual site that will be used, or I'll try to make a website with something I've never used before like Next.js and a CRM or something like that.
